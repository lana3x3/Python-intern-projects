This project focuses on leveraging data science and
machine learning techniques to analyze employee emotions and moods using data such as text inputs, facial expressions, or speech.
The system will provide insights into the emotional state of employees and recommend tasks that align with their mood to enhance productivity and well-being. Additionally, it will detect employees who may be experiencing stress,
burnout, or other negative emotions and notify HR or higher authorities to take timely action. This ensures that appropriate support, such as counseling, stress management programs, or task adjustments, can be provided, fostering a healthier and more empathetic workplace environment.
